# formgram
Small extension for pyTelegramBotAPI library for building interactive forms in Telegram bots without storing intermediate state.


## Install

I haven't published the package on PyPI yet. If you want to use `formgram` on this early stage, please just **vendor it**. It is a single file: [formgram.py](formgram.py). I already created [the issue to distribute the package via PyPI](https://github.com/keshamin/formgram/issues/2).


## Examples
